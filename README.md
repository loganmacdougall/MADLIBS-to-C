# Madlibs to C

This is a website which will ask you to provide a story, which the user will put blanks in. For each blank in the story, some inputs will appear asking what the blank is and how long the input length can be. As your entering all of this, the C code is being generated below, and can be copy, pasted, and run without issue.

To put a blank in your story, you would type `%s`, and the input fields necessary will appear automatically.
